Lucie Jemima has recently graduated from the BA (Hons) Illustration course at Falmouth University after studying there for three years. Now back in her home county of Devon, she takes inspiration from the beautiful natural surroundings that inform her botanical work. The context of her work varies from more narrative-based pieces and handmade zines, to packaging and branding-based work. Keen to develop her individual visual language, she uses different media to illustrate numerous subjects and projects to discover new ways of creating art.
