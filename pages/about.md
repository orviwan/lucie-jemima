Lucie Jemima is currently a third year BA (Hons) illustration student at Falmouth University who is soon to graduate. Originally from Devon, she takes inspiration from the beautiful natural surroundings that inform her botanical work. The context of her work varies from more narrative based pieces and handmade zines, to packaging and branding-based work. Keen to develop her individual visual language, she uses different media to illustrate numerous subjects and projects to discover new ways of creating art.
