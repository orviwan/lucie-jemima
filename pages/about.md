Lucie Jemima is a freelance illustrator currently based in the south-west of England. She recently graduated from the BA (Hons) Illustration course at Falmouth University with a 2:1, after studying there for three years. Now back in her home county of Devon, she mainly creates work digitally using Procreate. Inspiration comes from her love of plants, animals and nature, with her work often featuring women or characters loosely based on herself. Recently, she has been making handmade earrings from polymer clay in lots of different shapes and colours, fulfilling her need to create physical artwork from time to time. She also runs an Etsy shop, where she sells her earrings, prints, zines & greetings cards.

Lucie also works part-time in a plant shop, where she often purchases plants for her growing indoor jungle. When she's not drawing, she can often be found cuddling up with her dog Jess by the fire, having a cup of tea.
